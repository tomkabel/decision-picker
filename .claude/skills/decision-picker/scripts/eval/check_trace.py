"""Protocol assertions over a decision-picker trace. Python >=3.10, stdlib only.

The artifact that actually executes is a prompt, so the only test that means
anything is whether the agent followed the protocol. These are *structural*
assertions — no LLM judge needed for any of them, which is what makes them cheap
enough to gate on.

WHAT --live CAN AND CANNOT SEE
------------------------------
No harness exposes its interactive question tool in headless sessions —
`AskUserQuestion` is absent from `claude -p`, `clarify` cannot render without a
TTY, and the pi extension UI likewise. Verified, not assumed. So a live run
cannot observe a real ask, and any harness that claims to is reading a
self-report.

What it observes instead, split by evidence class:

  ground truth   the exact payload `rubric.py` received and the verdict it
                 returned, captured by pointing $DECISION_PICKER_LOG at the run
                 directory. This is the step with all the variance in it, and it
                 is fully observable — sub-scores, evidence levels, feasibility
                 gating, weights, stability.
  ground truth   which tools ran, parsed from the driver's stream output
                 (JSON events on stdout).
  self-reported  the interactive-ask arguments the agent *would* have passed.
                 Linted, but recorded as `source: self-reported` and never
                 confused with an executed call.

Repeats measure what a hardcoded noise constant used to assert: run the same
scenario k times and count how often the recommendation agrees with itself.

A trace is:
    {"scenario": str,
     "forced_panel": bool, "high_stakes": bool,
     "candidates": [str, ...],
     "events": [
        {"type": "rubric",     "recommended": str, "separated": bool,
                               "reasons": [str], "excluded": [str]},
        {"type": "flag",       "kind": "injection", "label": str},
        {"type": "escalation", "ran": bool},
        {"type": "ask",        "options": [{"label": str, "description": str}]},
        {"type": "answer",     "label": str, "is_other": bool},
        {"type": "action",     "label": str}
     ]}

Every `label` is an exact option label, copied verbatim — never a sentence, never
a paraphrase. `action.label` is the label of the option you acted on, so that it
can be compared against `answer.label` character for character.

In a headless run there is no user, so `answer` and `action` are the agent's own
account of a step that did not happen. They are kept because a trace that
contradicts itself is still a finding, but they are the weakest thing here; the
rubric events are ground truth and carry the weight.
