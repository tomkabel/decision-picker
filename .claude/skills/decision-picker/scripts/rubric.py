"""Weighted multi-criteria scoring for decision-picker. Python >=3.10, stdlib only.

The number this produces is an internal sort key, NOT a confidence probability.
A weighted total is a multi-criteria *utility* score; `P(this option is correct)`
is a different quantity that nothing here estimates. Never render it to the user
as a percentage — see SKILL.md, which carries the behavioral anchors that make
the sub-scores mean anything at all.

Three design decisions worth knowing before you read the code:

1. **Ranking is on the conservative bound, not the point estimate.** An option
   with unknown sub-scores used to be imputed at the mean of its known ones,
   which let ignorance outrank evidence: an all-unknown option scored 50 and beat
   a fully-grounded 45. Sorting on `lo` makes an unknown cost you, which is the
   only direction that does not reward declining to look.

2. **Sub-scores are the three band midpoints, not free 0-100.** The anchors in
   SKILL.md define three levels per criterion. Accepting 87 invents 19 points of
   resolution no anchor can justify, and that false precision lands straight in
   the sort key.

3. **`evidence_strength` is not weighted.** How much *you* verified is a property
   of your knowledge, not of the option. Mixing it into the utility sum makes an
   option better because it was researched. It is carried separately and gates
   escalation: weak evidence means go get evidence, not dock points.

Usage:
    echo '{"choices": [...]}' | python3 rubric.py
    echo '{"choices": [...]}' | python3 rubric.py --json
    echo '{"choices": [...], "pick": "Redis"}' | python3 rubric.py --log .decisions.log
